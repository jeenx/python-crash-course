# Exercise 5-1. Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Print a
# statement describing each test and your prediction for the results of each
# test. Your code should look something like this:
"""
car = 'subaru'
print("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.") print(car == 'subaru')
print("\nIs car == 'audi'? I predict False.") print(car == 'audi')
• Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line 
evaluates to True or False.
• Create at least ten tests. Have at least five tests evaluate to True and 
another five tests evaluate to False.
