# Exercise 6-2. Favorite Numbers: Use a dictionary to store people’s favorite
# numbers. Think of five names, and use them as keys in your dictionary. Think
# of a favorite number for each person, and store each as a value in your
# dictionary. Print each person’s name and their favorite number. For even more
# fun, poll a few friends and get some actual data for your program.

person_fav_nums = {"jill": 20, "fill": 16, "bill": 28, "dill": 7, "hill": 52}

jill_num = person_fav_nums["jill"]

fill_num = person_fav_nums["fill"]
print(f"Fill's favorite number is {fill_num}")

bill_num = person_fav_nums["bill"]
