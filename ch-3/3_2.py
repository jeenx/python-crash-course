# Exercise 3-2. Greetings: Start with the list you used in Exercise 3-1, but
# instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The
# text of each message should be the same, but each message should be
# personalized with the person’s name.

names = ["first friend", "second friend", "third friend"]

print(f" Hi {names[0]}, how are you doing?")
print(f" Hi {names[1]}, how are you doing?")
print(f" Hi {names[2]}, how are you doing?")
