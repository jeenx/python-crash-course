# Exercise 3-11. Intentional Error: If you havenâ€™t received an index error in
# one of your programs yet, try to make one happen. Change an index in one of
# your programs to produce an index error. Make sure you correct the error
# before clos- ing the program.

colors = ["red", "blue", "green"]

# Purposely used [3] to get an Index error
# print(colors[3])

# Grabbing last item from the list
print(colors[-1])
