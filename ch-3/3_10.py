# 3-10. Every Function: Think of something you could store in a list. For
# example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities,
# languages, or any- thing else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list
# containing these items and then uses each function introduced in this chapter
# at least once.
