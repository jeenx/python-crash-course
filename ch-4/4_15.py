"""
• Use four spaces for each indentation level. Set your text editor to insert 
four spaces every time you press tab, if you haven’t already done so (see 
Appendix B for instructions on how to do this).
• Use less than 80 characters on each line, and set your editor to show a 
vertical guideline at the 80th character position.
• Don’t use blank lines excessively in your program files
